# Configuration

Load the cards at `/admin`

# Game

It is a loose adaptation of the DC Comics deck building game with some of the cards.  Not all the rules and game features have been implemented.  This nodejs version gives you a vague idea on what the card game feels like.

# Implementation

Since Heroku does not support websockets yet, the hosted version uses long polling.
